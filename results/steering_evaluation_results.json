      "response": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to add the numbers 15 and 3.\n\n## Step 2: Add the numbers\nTo add these numbers, we simply place them side by side and add the corresponding digits.\n\n## Step 3: Perform the addition\nStarting from the rightmost digits, we add 5 (from 15) and 3 (from 3), which gives us 8. Then, we add the leftmost digits, which are 1 (from 15) and 0 (from 3), but since there is no digit in the 3, we only consider the 1 from 15. So, we add 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the results\nWe combine the results from the previous step to get the final answer. Since we added the digits from right to left, we need to make sure the result is in the correct format. The result of adding 5 and 3 is 8, and the result of adding 1 and 0 is 1. Therefore, the final answer is 18.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
